#
# This can be one of the following:
# - "light": Streamlit's default light theme.
# - "dark" : Streamlit's default dark theme.
# - A local file path to a TOML theme file: A local custom theme, like
#   "themes/custom.toml".
# - A URL to a TOML theme file: An externally hosted custom theme, like
#   "https://example.com/theme.toml".
#
# A TOML theme file must contain a [theme] table with theme options.
# Any theme options defined in the app's config.toml file will override
# those defined in the TOML theme file.
