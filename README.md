## 🚀 Getting Started

### Setting up Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses **pre-commit** to ensure code quality and formatting are consistent across the team. To set up the hooks, make sure you have `pre-commit` installed and run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
uv install pre-commit
pre-commit install
